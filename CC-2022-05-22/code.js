Information
Messi goal scoring statistics:

Task
Create these three variables and store the appropriate values using the table above:
laLigaGoals
championsLeagueGoals
copaDelReyGoals
Create a fourth variable named totalGoals that stores the sum of all of Messi's goals for this year. */


//SAMPLE TESTS:
/*describe("total goals", function(){
    it ("should equal the total", function () {
      Test.assertEquals(totalGoals, 58)
    })
})*/

//P:Are there to be any other submissions that are not accounted for already, will they be from a different league, can goals be taken away
//R: The total number of goals across all leagues from Messi


//SOLUTION:
//P: Assign values to all the variables
//And put the total in totalGoals variable
//Show work
var laLigaGoals = 43
var championsLeagueGoals = 10
var copaDelReyGoals = 5

var totalGoals = 58

//E: It's just about assigning variables a value
